‘Embracing Wholeness’ a program which contributed to life and its evolution by enlarging the capacities of youth workers to support youth by cultivating their innate wholeness and helping them to acquire life skills that would enable their insertion on social and professional levels. From 7th to 14th of April 22 youth workers from 8 European countries gathered in the mountains of Romania. They experienced and learnt practices from holistic education and nature-based models for cultivating the full human potential of youth and enabling them to progress in a healthy and mature way. May they continuously embrace wholeness and create the spaces for others to do that as well. This training course was supported by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union.
